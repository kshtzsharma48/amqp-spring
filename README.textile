A very raw sketch for a possible AMQP-Spring integration.

h2. What it does do atm.?

* Provides connection and channel factory abstractions
* Provides classes for exchanges, queues, bindings (many bindings wrapped in one binding class actually), messages and subscriptions (the latter two are very raw currently)
* A custom namespace for components (exchanges, queues, bindings)
* A few preconfigured components like reply queues or the default exchange

h2. What is planned for it?

* Refreshable channels and connection (that is - they can re-establish a connection to a message broker if the connection fails
* Autowiring of all channel requiring components if only one connection is detected in the application context
* Better abstractions for producers and consumers
* Sensible exceptions
* Stuff
